                <h4>Welcome to BookTree!</h4>
                <p> BookTree is a vibrant gathering place for the exchange of ideas, and discussion of books and the
                    literary arts. It is a place where all are welcome to continue their journey, expand their
                    knowledge, feed their interests and further their education through books and literature. It is a
                    place for families to find and enjoy the best of current and past literature. A place where our
                    customers can hear local and traveling writers, authors and poets present their work. We also have
                    FREE writing workshops (most 1st Saturdays). We are happy to work with Book Clubs, recommend books,
                    order anything that is print (that we don't already have on our shelves). We have gift certificates,
                    a revolving selection of new and gently-used books.</p>
                <h4>Indepdent Bookstores</h4>
                <p> BookTree is one of the few remaining independent bookstores on the Eastside that will be an
                    important part of our city’s identity. It will be successful because of the generous support of our
                    community who values and patronizes a stand-alone retail bookstore. Together we'll keep your passion
                    for reading and books alive and well. Remember to visit and support your local bookstore often so
                    that it survives and serves the community for years to come.</p>
                <h4>Our Beginnings</h4>
                <p> BookTree was started by 2 people who are passionate about the inherent value of books, reading,
                    writing, listening and sharing diverse ideas, and viewpoints. 1 of these people retired and so 1
                    person and wonderful occasional volunteers create the BookTree experience for YOU!</p>
