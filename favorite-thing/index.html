    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is Maya! There are multiple things I like about school, including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>the EPS campus</li>
        <li>cafeteria food</li>
        <li>the EPS rowing team</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, my favorite thing about school is the quality of instruction provided by the amazing faculty!! I've had
        some awesome teachers at EPS who have made classes interesting and fun.</p>
