                <h2 class="primary-text">Dear Friends,</h2>
                <p>

                    Having achieved my objective in opening a bookstore in Kirkland, it is time now for me to retire
                    and
                    for Chris to carry Booktree into the future. <br>

                <p>I want to thank you all for the wonderful almost 30 years at Parkplace Books and Booktree, for
                    your
                    support in tough times, like when Parkplace Books was flooded. The way the community came
                    together
                    to keep the bookstore open was heartwarming and that same sentiment helped Booktree open and
                    remain
                    viable. <br></p>

                <p>It has been a joy to present so many authors local, national and international over the years. We
                    are so fortunate here in the Northwest that we have such a vibrant book scene. I remember well
                    the
                    release of the Harry Potter books and the wonderful late night parties. A once-in-a-lifetime
                    experience for so many children (and their parents). <br></p>

                <p>It is events like this that create opportunities for people to come together and foster a sense
                    of
                    community. I am so fortunate to have been part of that. I have also truly enjoyed the many
                    conversations we've had, so many of you became friends, not just customers. To share in your
                    joys
                    and sorrows and to find just the right book for each occasion. Books are so much more than just
                    escapism. <br></p>

                <p>It is with sadness that I leave Booktree but also with excitement in this next phase. I look
                    forward
                    to spending more time with Charlotte my new granddaughter and Cole my 6 year old California
                    grandson. I also have a personal library to read, maybe I'll read all of them in this lifetime!
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>My best wishes and gratitude go to Chris and to his future partner for the continued success of
                    Booktree and it's vital importance to the heart of Kirkland. <br>
                </p>
                <p>I will miss being part of your lives, you have certainly enriched mine. <br>
                </p>
                <p> With gratitude and heartfelt thanks, <br></p>

                <p>Mary <br></p>
